# Ringtail
Package for creating SQLite database from virtual screening DLGs and performing filtering on results.

Ringtail reads collections of Docking Log File (DLG) results from virtual screenings performed with [AutoDock-GPU](https://github.com/ccsb-scripps/AutoDock-GPU) and deposits them into
a SQLite database. It then allows for the filtering of results with numerous pre-defined filtering options, generation of simple result plots, export of resulting
molecule poses, and export of CSVs of result data. DLG parsing is parallelized across the user's CPU.

Ringtail is developed by the [Forli lab](https://forlilab.org/) at the
[Center for Computational Structural Biology (CCSB)](https://ccsb.scripps.edu)
at [Scripps Research](https://www.scripps.edu/).

## Basic Usage
Upon calling Ringtail for the first time, the user must specify where the program can find DLGs to write to the newly-created database. This is done using the
`--file`, `--file_path`, and/or `--file_list` options. Any combination of these options can be used, and multiple arguments for each are accepted. dlg.gz files
are also accepted. After this initial run, a database is created and may be read directory for subsequent filtering operations.
#### Inputs
When searching for DLG files in the directory specified with `--file_path`, Ringtail will search for files with the pattern `*.dlg*`. This may be changed with the
`--pattern` option. Note also that, by default, Ringtail will only search the directory provided in `--file_path` and not subdirectories. Subdirectory searching
is enabled with the `--recursive` flag.

Once a database is written, this database can be read in directly without re-writting using the `--input_db` option. To add new DLGs to an existing database, the `--add_results` flag can be used in conjuction with `--input_db` and `--file`, `--file_path`, and/or `--file_list` options. To overwrite an existing database, use the `--overwrite` flag in combination with `--file`, `--file_path`, and/or `--file_list` options.
#### Outputs
By default, the newly-created database will be named `output.db`. This name may be changed with the `--output_db` option.

By default, Ringtail will store the best-scored (lowest energy) binding pose from the first 3 pose clusters in the DLG. The number of clusters stored may be
changed with the `--max_poses` option. The `--store_all_poses` flag may also be used to override `--max_poses` and store every pose from every DLG.

The default log name is `output_log.txt` and by default will include the ligand name and binding energy of every pose passing filtering criteria. The log name
may be changed with the `--log` option and the information written to the log can be specified with `--out_fields`. By default, only the information for the
top-scoring binding pose will be written to the log. If desire, each individual passing pose can be written by using the `--all_poses` flag.
#### Filters
When running with default settings (no user-specified filters), the only filter used is `--epercentile 1.0`. This gives the top 1% of poses by overall binding energy score.

## Interaction filter formatting
The `--vdw`, `--hb`, and `--react_res` interaction filters must be specified in the order `CHAIN:RES:NUM:ATOM_NAME`. Any combination of that information may be used, as long as 3 colons are present and the information ordering between the colons is correct. All desired interactions of a given type (e.g. `--vdw`) may be specified with a single option tag (`--vdw=B:THR:276:,B:HIS:226:`) or separate tags (`--vdw=B:THR:276: --vdw=B:HIS:226:`).

## Using filters file
Filters may also be read from a text file given with the `--filters_file` tag. Below is an example of a filters text file:
```
#     this is a comment
eworst=-0.4
ebest=-100
leworst=-0.2
#    vdw=A:THR:276:
#    vdw=B:HIS:36:
react_res=A:LYS:307:
react_count=1
hb_count=10
max_miss=1
```

## Potential pitfalls
When importing DLG files into a database with Ringtail, the files must have interaction analysis already performed. This is specified with `-C 1` when running [AutoDock-GPU](https://github.com/ccsb-scripps/AutoDock-GPU).
