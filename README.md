# Ringtail
Package for creating SQLite database from virtual screening DLGs and performing filtering on results.

Ringtail reads collections of DLG results from virtual screenings performed with [AutoDock-GPU](https://github.com/ccsb-scripps/AutoDock-GPU) and deposits them into
a SQLite database. It then allows for the filtering of results with numerous pre-defined filtering options, generation of simple result plots, export of resulting
molecule poses, and export of CSVs of result data. DLG parsing is parallelized accross the user's CPU.

Ringtail is developed by the [Forli lab](https://forlilab.org/) at the
[Center for Computational Structural Biology (CCSB)](https://ccsb.scripps.edu)
at [Scripps Research](https://www.scripps.edu/).

## Basic Usage
Upon calling Ringtail for the first time, the user must specify where the program can find DLGs to write to the newly-created database. This is done using the
`--file`, `--file_path`, and/or `--file_list` options. Any combination of these options can be used, and multiple arguments for each are accepted. dlg.gz files
are also accepted.
### Defaults
The following section outlines the default setting when running Ringtail:
#### Inputs
When searching for DLG files in the directory specified with `--file_path`, Ringtail will search for files with the pattern `*.dlg*`. This may be changed with the
`--pattern` option. Note also that, by default, Ringtail will only search the directory provided in `--file_path` and not subdirectories. Subdirectory searching
is enabled with the `--recursive` flag.
#### Outputs
By default, the newly-created database will be named `output.db`. This name may be changed with the `--output_db` option.

By default, Ringtail will store the best-scored (lowest energy) binding pose from the first 3 pose clusters in the DLG. The number of clusters stored may be
changed with the `--max_poses` option. The `--store_all_poses` flag may also be used to override `--max_poses` and store every pose from every DLG.

The default log name is `output_log.txt` and by default will include the ligand name and binding energy of every pose passing filtering criteria. The log name
may be changed with the `--log` option and the information written to the log can be specified with `--out_fields`. If desired, only the information for the
top-scoring binding pose may be written to the log by using the `--one_pose` flag.
